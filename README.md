I wanted to learn something new and wanted to expand my knowledge of Deep learning. 

Learned a new language and Tool called MatLab. 

You must have it installed to run this program.

In addition you need these App packages.

WHAT IT DOES ! 


Used transfer learning. 
This program uses a camera to detect various objects then uses a network of 25 objects to choose which grip type a prosthetic arm may use to hold said item. 

IF it cant determine the object then it will use the network to determine what the best grip to use. 

Can detect with at least 90% accuracy.
